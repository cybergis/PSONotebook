# Introduction to Particle Swarm Optimization

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was first introduced in [1995 by James Kennedy and Russell Eberhart](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1995.488968). The algorithm began as a simulation of social flocking behaviors like those exhibited by flocks of birds and schools of fish, specifically of birds searching a cornfield, but was found to be useful for training feedforward multilayer pernceptron neural networks. Since then, PSO has been adapted in a variety of ways and applied to problems including [wireless-sensor networks](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2054080), [classifying biological data](https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2005.1501608), [scheduling workflow applications in cloud computing environments](https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2010.31), [Image classification](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2006.312968) and [power systems](https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2007.896686). In this notebook we explore PSO's usefulness for calibration, with a focus on spatially-explicit agent-based models (ABMs).

## TODO:

* Add more exposition and examples now that code has been moved out of notebook
* Add tests
